# Etch-a-Sketch

My implementation of the Etch-a-Sketch javascript challenge in The Odin Project Foundation Course.

There are some slight deviations from the original task.
	
- Instead of prompt to ask for grid size there is a slider instead
- I wasn't able to complete the second optional task of a grayscale version but did manage to get the rainbow version done.

## Acknowledgements
- The layout was inspired by some of the previous submissions particularly the ones by [Michael Osman](https://michalosman.github.io/etch-a-sketch/) and [Tom M.](https://tmcerlean.github.io/etch-a-sketch/). 
- The slider was modified from [this](https://codepen.io/juanbrujo/pen/uIqaw) codepen.
- The code for the buttons was taken from [here](https://saruwakakun.com/en/css3-buttons) and modified thereafter.

## Final Comments
Oh boy! This was a challenge. TOP basically just threw me into (what felt like) the deep end of the pool and told me to figure out how to swim. I mean granted they did teach some basics of javascript and give a skeletal how-to checklist approach to the problem but what I had to use for this project was completely different from anything they had taught in the previous lessons.

By far the biggest challenge for me was figuring out how the random colorizer worked. Something was going wrong one way or the other and I feel like I stumbled on to the solution rather than arrived at it logically. 

One thing worth thinking about is my approach to the problem. Initially I was only aiming to have a barebones functional grid working where all the parameters were fixed and I just had to worry about getting the grid elements to change color on mouseover. However as I finished each step and went to attempt the next step in the solution I realised I had to redo/modify some of the previous sections because of the additional complexity. I'm wondering now if I should have approached the whole problem with the finished solution in mind and approached it that way or if this was indeed the best approach to the solution. I'll have to think about this when I get to the next problem.

Finally, I will be revisiting this code later to try the grayscale version but for now I'm happy with this.
